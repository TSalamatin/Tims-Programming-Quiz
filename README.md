In this application, I was tasked to design a small Programming quiz. The application will open up with a simple opening screen and will begin once the Start Quiz button is pressed. The User will be timed with finishing as many quetions as possible in 60 seconds, which is displayed in the right hand corner of the quiz container, with the current score being displayed in the opposite/left hand corner. The script will pull from an array of questions that will display in the container at the top, along with the associated answers being displayed underneath as buttons. Underneath the option buttons, the interface will display if the User was right or wrong with their previous selection by indicating 'Correct!' or 'Wrong!'. Afer the quiz is finished, the user will be promped to enter their name to log their score, as well as displaying 'Congrats! New Highscore!' if the user has the most points logged into their local storage. After submitting their name, they will be taken to a list of all the names and scores logged in the local storage, which is listed highest to lowest score top to bottom.
